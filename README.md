# Problem Statement 
The problem that I chose to focus on is how income of a
population, the amount tourist income affects the amount of business
in a given city. This will be used to find the best city, to open a new
Restaurant. The background of this problem is that a major problem
about opening a new Restaurant is that they do not have enough
customers or traffic in the selected area. This is a problem because
we need new and thriving restaurants to help bring income to an area.
This will also help the locals in the cities because it will provide jobs. In
almost every way you look at it opening up a new restaurant will help
people either directly or indirectly. The hardest part is finding a good
area where the market isn't too saturated or crowded for the
restaurant, and this project will help a theoretical restaurant choose a
city and even a section of a city to open up the said restaurant. This
project will show the best area out of the following 4 major U.S cities;
Baltimore, Huston, Richmond, and Phoenix.
