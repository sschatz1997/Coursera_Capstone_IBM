# Coursera Capstone IBM Data Science Project

# Problem Statement 
The problem that I chose to focus on is how income of a
population, the amount tourist income affects the amount of business
in a given city. This will be used to find the best city, to open a new
Restaurant. The background of this problem is that a major problem
about opening a new Restaurant is that they do not have enough
customers or traffic in the selected area. This is a problem because
we need new and thriving restaurants to help bring income to an area.
This will also help the locals in the cities because it will provide jobs. In
almost every way you look at it opening up a new restaurant will help
people either directly or indirectly. The hardest part is finding a good
area where the market isn't too saturated or crowded for the
restaurant, and this project will help a theoretical restaurant choose a
city and even a section of a city to open up the said restaurant. This
project will show the best area out of the following 4 major U.S cities;
Baltimore, Huston, Richmond, and Phoenix.

# What data is being used to support my problem statement?
The data that I used is:
- Population
  - This will be used to predict traffic to the restaurant.
- Average net income
  - This will help decide how much to charge based on the regulars that would come to the restaurant.
- Annual income from tourism
  - This will decide or help find out how to classify some of the data.
- Number of restaurants
  - This will help pick a location for the new restaurant.
- Type of restaurant
  - This will check the market saturation for types of restaurants.
- Latitude and longitude of the cities
  - This will help map the spots and graph them

All of this data will go back a certain time to account for todayâ€™s global
pandemic and to gather more data to have a better model view for
training and other data models.
